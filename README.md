## BinaryTreeVisitor

This code shows the Visitor pattern used on a binary tree data structure. The _novisitor_ folder has code that does not use the pattern, and then the _visitor_ folder enhances this code to have the tree implement the visitor patter, and then have two computations, printing and summing, use the pattern.
